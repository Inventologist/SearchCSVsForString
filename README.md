# SearchFilesForString
Quick search for a string in a set of CSVs exported from any system.

## Current Functionality ##
Right now, this only searches CSVs in a directory.  

## Desired functionality ##
I'd like to get this to go through Excel files next.

## USES ##
In cross-referencing information, quick searches are needed to see what server names, database names are listed.  In most cases, searching them using your CMDB or other CI system can be time consuming.  Export your CI classes, then use this to see what's what!

Enjoy!
