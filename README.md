# SearchCSVsForString
Quick search for a string in a set of CSVs exported from any system.

This will go through any CSVs in a directory (maybe we could get this to do Excel also??)

USES:  In cross-referencing information, quick searches are needed to see what server names, database names are listed.  In most cases, searching them using your CMDB or other CI system can be time consuming.  Export your CI classes, then use this to see what's what!

Enjoy!
